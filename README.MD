First of all, this code is trivial and very basic, and uses libraries like open cv, mediapipe. 
Secondly, this code was tested in the older OS, Raspberry Pi Buster OS. I dont know why, but the refrence page we used used the buster os instead of the new bullseye/ bookworm version. It has to do with OPEN-CV not working properly with the newer OS of raspberry pi. 
Also this wasnt tested on the newer raspberry pi 5. We dont know if it works or not, as we only had the pi 4. If you have the pi 5, you can clone it and test it.
